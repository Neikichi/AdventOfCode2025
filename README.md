# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) implemented in **C++20/23**.

This project is part of my journey to learn modern C++ at **42 School**.

## 📁 Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in its own directory:
```
DayXX/
├── part1/
└── part2/
```

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **C++20/23** - Modern C++ features and best practices
- Focus on learning: 
  - STL containers and algorithms
  - Range-based programming
  - Modern C++ idioms
  - Memory safety

## 🚀 Building & Running

```bash
cd DayXX/partY
# Add your build commands here
```
